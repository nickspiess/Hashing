Hashing Homework:

1. File List : All must be in same directory
- Game.java
- HashChain.java
- HashNode.java
- List.java
- Node.java
- Queue.java
- QueueList.java
- SLList.java
- TNode.java
- dictionary.txt


2. In order to run this code, run it from the command line.
- If running from the command line, you must first compile all the Java programs using "javac *.java". Then,
you input "java Game <first-word> <second-word> <amount-of-hops>"
- <first-word>: The first word you are checking permutation-wise
- <second-word>: The second word you are checking permutation-wise
- <amount-of-hops>: The amount of hops you want the game to check

3. I decided to make an ArrayList that kept track of the known words for me.  This helped make sure I didn't get any
overlaps and stuck in a loop.

 4. Even though this project was shorter, it was a little more difficult for me to grasp at first.  The idea of
 permutating words didn't come across very intuitively to me, so this project took less work, but more thought
 than past projects.
